Pip-Boy 3000 Mark IV – A Retro Fallout-Inspired Personal Interface

Welcome to Pip-Boy 3000 Mark IV, a small side-project inspired by the classic Pip-Boy terminals from the Fallout universe.
It’s not meant to be a huge app or a fancy framework — just a personal, retro-styled interface built for fun, immersion, and everyday use.

This project recreates the vibe of an in-game terminal: green glow, vintage flicker, a subtle boot sequence, ambient sounds, and a simple but functional layout. Everything works entirely on the client side, with no servers and no external dependencies.

🌿 What’s Inside

The interface is divided into several familiar sections:

📊 STATS

A minimal recreation of the character screen:

HP, AP, EXP and Level

Limb health visualization

Radiation meter with slight random fluctuation

Weight indicator

Real-time clock and date synced with the user’s device

It doesn’t try to be a real RPG system — just something that feels alive on the screen.

📦 INVENTORY

A place for quick notes, thoughts, reminders, or whatever you want to throw in.
Typing produces a soft retro key-click sound, and everything is saved automatically using localStorage, meaning your notes stay only on your device.


📁 DATA

A small collection of “terminal logs” and a diary-style entry.
Mostly atmospheric, mostly for fun.
Think of it as your personal vault terminal.


🗺 MAP

This tab links to an online map of the Commonwealth for quick browsing.
It keeps the Fallout feeling without trying to rebuild the map manually.


📻 RADIO

Three in-universe radio stations you can switch between, each opening a playlist (Spotify or YouTube) that matches the Fallout theme.


🔒 Privacy & Safety

Pip-Boy 3000 Mark IV runs entirely in the browser.
No accounts, no tracking, no API keys, no external services.

All saved data — like your notes — lives only inside your local browser storage, meaning:

It never leaves your device

It isn’t uploaded anywhere

Anyone else using the project will only see their own local data


It’s fully safe to publish on GitHub.


🚀 How to Use
